# Next.js Project with TypeScript, Docker, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Testing Library, Storybook, Styled Components, and More

This is a boilerplate for a Next.js project with various features already integrated. The features include:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking and improving the code quality
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerizing the application and ensuring consistency across different environments
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and enforcing code quality standards
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting the code automatically and consistently
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing the code and ensuring correctness
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for writing user-focused tests
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing and testing UI components in isolation
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling the components using CSS-in-JS
- [Next Font](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimizing and loading custom Google Fonts
- [Next PWA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa) for adding Progressive Web App (PWA) features to the application
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for running scripts automatically on Git hooks
- [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) for running linters on staged files only
- [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) for enforcing commit message conventions
- [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for making commit messages easier to write and understand
- [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) for generating code snippets and templates

To create a new application from this template, run the following command:

```bash
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/rafikmoreira/next-boilerplate
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
